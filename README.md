# image-learning-architectures
A curated collection of classic image classification projects implemented from scratch, including heuristic algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Scikit-learn models. Built for academic coursework at UMT, this repository focuses on mastering foundational vision systems using datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10.
